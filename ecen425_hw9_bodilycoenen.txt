1. 	Longest critical section: Found in YKSemPost - 232 instructions
	This was measured by placing a breakpoint at the call of the assembly mutex function (corresponding to YKEnterMutex) and then using the "eto" command to measure how many instructions
	occurred until the assembly unmutex function (corresponding to YKExitMutex). 
	This process was repeated for every critical section, multiple times, and the longest section was determined.
	Other lengthy critical sections are: YKSemPend - 141, YKDelayTask - 138, YKQPend - 141, YKTickHandler - 194, YKQPost - 154 

2. 	Worst case interrupt latency: 232 + 20 = 253 instructions.
	This was measured by adding the length of the longest critical section to the length of the longest ISR (counted by referencing the assembly file).

3. 	Overhead to post to a semaphore: Maximum of 193 instructions.
	This was measured by placing a breakpoint at the call of YKSemPost, then using the "eto" command to measure how many instructions occured until the "ret" instruction of YKSemPost.
	This process was repeated many times to determine the maximum number of instructions.

4. 	Overhead to pend to a semaphore: Maximum of 162 instructions.
	This was measured by placing a breakpoint at the call of YKSemPend, then using the "eto" command to measure how many instructions occured until the "ret" instruction of YKSemPend.
	This process was repeated many times to determine the maximum number of instructions.

5. 	Overhead to switch contexts with YKDelayTask: Maximum of 133 instructions.
	This was measured by placing a breakpoint at the call of YKSemPost, then using the "eto" command to measure how many instructions occured until the "iret" instruction of the assembly dispatcher function.
	This process was repeated many times to determine the maximum number of instructions.
